A Node.js module I'm currently working on.

You will be able to enter an array of text snippets e.g. stories
and sort them into specific number of clusters (user defined) with the K-Means algorithm
or an algorithmically gererated number of clusters using the hierarchical agglomerative clustering algorithim.

For a demonstration of how this will work look visit http://ec2-54-229-45-195.eu-west-1.compute.amazonaws.com/ and 
search for jaguar. 

It will give you different categories such as car or panthera etc
